## Hi! We are the NoCE Lab ðŸ‘‹

Neurobiology of Concepts Expression Laboratory at UNIGE
We study the cognitive and neural correlates of semantic knowledge and their interplay with language. We use both behavioral and neuroimaging techniques. We believe in science as a collaborative effort aimed at the pursuit of knowledge for the benefit of humanity.
